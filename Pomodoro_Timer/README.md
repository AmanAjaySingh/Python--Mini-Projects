# Pomodoro Timer

## üõ†Ô∏è Description

Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. It helps you stay focused by dividing work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This script allows you to set custom work and break intervals, as well as the number of cycles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used
- Python

## üåü How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the file `PomodoroTimer.py` in your Python IDE or text editor.
3. Set your preferred work duration, break duration, and number of cycles.
4. Run the script.
5. The script will guide you through each work and break interval.

### Example:

```python
workMinutes = 25
breakMinutes = 5
cycles = 4
pomodoroTimer(workMinutes, breakMinutes, cycles)

This will run a Pomodoro session with 25-minute work intervals and 5-minute breaks for 4 cycles.
```
