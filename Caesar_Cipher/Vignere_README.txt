# Vigen√®re Cipher: Classical Text Encryption

<p align="center">
<img src="assests/main.png" width=40% height=40%>

## üõ†Ô∏è Description

This script implements the **Vigen√®re Cipher**, a classic polyalphabetic substitution encryption technique. It accepts a keyword from the user to encode and decode messages. The same keyword must be used to decrypt the output, making it a lightweight reversible encryption tool. This is a great intro project for learning about ciphers and key-based text transformations.

The script demonstrates:
1. A `VigenereCipher` class with methods to encrypt and decrypt alphabetic strings
2. Character-level transformation based on a repeating keyword
3. Custom `transform()` logic that handles both encryption and decryption

Feel free to enhance it with non-alphabet support, file-based encryption, or use it inside a larger pipeline.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used

- Python 3.x standard library only
- No external packages required

## üåü How to run

To execute the script, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
python vigenere_cipher.py
```

When prompted:
- Enter a **keyword** to serve as the encryption key
- Enter the plaintext you'd like to encrypt
- The script will output the encrypted text and decrypt it back immediately

Use `CTRL + C` to exit at any point.

## üì∫ Demo

An example prompt might look like:

```
Enter encryption keyword: lemon
Enter text to encrypt: hello world
Encrypted text: siprb xbpqe
Decrypted back: hello world
```
