## üõ†Ô∏è Description
This repository contains a voice translator application built in Python. The application allows users to input voice commands, detects the language of the input, translates the text into the desired destination language using the Google Translate API, and reads out the translated text while also displaying it in the console.

### Features

1. Voice Command Input: The application accepts voice commands as input, making it convenient for users to communicate their translation requests.

2. Language Detection: The application utilizes language detection to automatically determine the language of the input. This helps in accurately translating the text into the desired language.

3. Google Translate API Integration: The translation functionality is powered by the Google Translate API. This ensures reliable and accurate translations from the source language to the destination language.

4. Voice Input for Destination Language: To specify the destination language, the application accepts voice input from the user. This simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual language selection.

5. Text-to-Speech and Console Display: Once the translation is complete, the application reads out the translated text using text-to-speech functionality. Additionally, the translated text is printed in the console for easy reference.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Languages or Frameworks Used
<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
To run the voice translator application, the following dependencies are required:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Google Translate API credentials
- Python libraries: SpeechRecognition, googletrans, pyttsx3, playsound

### üåü How to run
