# Blackjack

## üõ†Ô∏è Description

This is a simple terminal-based Blackjack game written in Python. The game follows the basic rules of Blackjack:
- Each player is dealt two cards initially.
- You can choose to draw another card (`hit`) or stop drawing (`stand`).
- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- The dealer (computer) draws cards until the score is 17 or higher.
- Aces are valued as 11, but can convert to 1 if needed.

The game automatically compares scores and determines the winner at the end.
